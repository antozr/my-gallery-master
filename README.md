## For made this project 
I have used differently CSS property : the css grid, the flex-box, the min/max - height and media querries for create the responsive. I have start the css in small size design for create the base and the bigest part of css, and I added the responsive with @media (min-width: 1200px), and all class in this media is for the big screen. 

For center the differetly container, I have used the flex-box property : flex-direction : column and align-items:center, with this all item is center compared at screen-size. 

For set differently images and theirs attribute the grid-areas , I have used the :nth-child() for add the property and the special size of images.
